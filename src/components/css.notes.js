-- Flex Container properties
1. flex-direction (row column row-reverse column-reverse)
2. justify-content (flex-start, flex-end, center, space-around, space-between, space-evenly) -  works across main axis
3. align-items (flex-start, flex-end, center) -  works across cross axis 
4. flex-wrap (wrap nowrap wrap-reverse) - specifies items are forced into single line or can be wrapped into multiple lines
   wrap-reverse changes cross axis direction
5. align-content(flex-start, flex-end, center, space-around, space-between, space-evenly) - works with align-item in cross axis, we can manipulate space on cross axis

-- Flex item properties
1. align-self (flex-start, flex-end, center stretch) - It works on cross axis to align itself.
2. flex-basis (px, % etc) -  gives width along main axis and has more priority than css width property.
3. flex-grow (number) -  it expands block on ration basis
4. flex-shrink (number) - it shrinks block on ration basis
5. order (number) - sets the order of the block, default order is 0.
